### Creator's Notes

After completing an online course in web development, I chose to create a simple, single-page website to practice my new and improved skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I landed on the Enchanted 8 Ball idea while pondering games that are easy to play. Over the course of just three days, in a total of less than ten hours, I created [the website you see here](https://dlgiltner.github.io/8Ball/). I started by creating images of the top and bottom sides of a "Magic 8 Ball" in Photoshop. Then I designed the layout and logo for the site, also in Photoshop, using the toy's box colors as inspiration. With a design ready, I completed the HTML and CSS fairly quickly. The Javascript functions for the two buttons were created last. I received no guidance on this project beyond searching the internet for help when needed.
